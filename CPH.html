                Having in mind that always we're going to have an average number of tickets whole month, I suggest to check everyday how many cases we closed at the end of the shift.
                Add up all the resolves from the week, and calculate how it was done compairing with the available time.

            <p>
                A normal average in a complete month are 2500 Replys and 1350 Resolves, to achieve and 7.5 in CPH.
