            <h2> We are going to start with some little steps that will help us to reach the completion of the CSAT and the CPH at the end of the month.

            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p> The first thing that we need to keep in mind is the first days of the month are esential to start the both metrics in the best way possible. Also CSAT and CPH on the first 15 days are extremely important to guarantee easy stability and a favorable
                control.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The second one, is having in mind that you have an average in whole month that is your ticket's amount of resolved cases, over the available hours that you have sheduled. The normal average in a month is a 200 - 205 hours completion, so it is important
                to take a count of the number about how many cases are we resolving day by day.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Excel tables are usually the best way to keep tracked the CPH and have a own control.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p> The amount of replies is also important, cause is a source of automations and have some weight in CPH result too. Big amount of resolves has to be companied by bigger amount of replies.

                It is important to left a significative amount of replies the last days before to finish our week.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have to take into a count that automations are always a handicap to improve our CPH. So, leaving before the days off with a considerable amount of replies will be really useful to have an increase reflected on our first day of the income week.
