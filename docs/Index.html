            <h2> Here, we going to start to some little steps that will help us to face the completion of the CSAT and the CPH at the of the month.

            </h2>

            <br>
            <p>The first thing that we have in mind is that the first days of the month are esential to start the both metrics in the best way possible. Also CSAT, and CPH, on the first 15 days are extremely important to guarantee a easy stability and a
                favorable control.
            </p>

            </br>
            <p>
                The second one, is that have in mind that you have an average in whole month that is your ticket amount of resolved cases, and the amount of the available hours that you have sheduled. The normal average in a month is a 175 - 185 hours completion, so
                it is important to take a count of the number about how many cases are we resolving day by day.
            </p>
            <hr>
            </br>
            <p> The amount of replys is also important, cause is a source of automations and have some weight in CPH result too. Big amount of resolves has to be companied by bigger amount of replys.

            <h3>
                It is too important to left a significative amount of replys the last days before to finish our week, based on our days off.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have to take in count that automations are always a handicap to an a positive impact on our CPH, so leaving to the days off with a considerable amount of replys will be really useful to check the next first day, the rise on the metric.
