                    Protect the first days of the every month as a little baby! It sounds funny, but the first days are
                    esential to get and to assure the CSAT, even if those first days we don't make the regular amount of
                    tickets to sustain our CPH, the first days are that much important to look deeply the players
                    requests,
                    look what they are feeling, and trying to be empathyc with them to "care" our baby CSAT the first
